## COVID-19 Tracker for La Habra, CA
As part of a [Bluebonnet](https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/) team volunteering for a city council campaign in La Habra, CA, I created a application using R and Shiny that tracked the number of daily cases reported and the cumulative number of cases reported in La Habra.
- [Tracker](https://devinbarkey.shinyapps.io/pc_-_la_habra/)
- [Code](https://github.com/devinjbarkey/devinjbarkey.github.io/blob/main/PC%20for%20La%20Habra/app.R)

## Using a Genetic Algorithm to Find Optimal Strategies in Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma
For the final project in *MATH 4630: Nonlinear Optimization*, I wrote a [program](https://github.com/devinjbarkey/devinjbarkey.github.io/tree/main/MATH%204630%20Project) which created a so-called genetic algorithm to attempt to identify optimal strategies for the iterated prisoner's dilemma game.
