# Hello There
Welcome to my site! Here you can find my resume, learn a little more about me, and check out some projects I've worked on. Please keep in mind that this is a **work in progress**.

# About Me

I'm a recent engineering/math Vanderbilt grad passionate about criminal justice and politics. I've lived in Virginia, Arkansas, Florida, and Tennessee. If you couldn't guess it from the first line of my site, I'm a huge *Star Wars* nerd. In my free time, I like to read, play video games, and play tennis.

# Projects

## Florida Voted for Four More Years of Trump... and a $15 Minimum Wage
Following the 2020 general election, I explored some seemingly-contradictory results in a short [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/devinjbarkey/devinjbarkey.github.io/blob/main/FL2020.ipynb).

## COVID-19 Tracker for La Habra, CA
As part of a [Bluebonnet](https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/) team volunteering for a city council campaign in La Habra, CA, I created a application using R and Shiny that tracked the number of daily cases reported and the cumulative number of cases reported in La Habra.

## Using a Genetic Algorithm to Find Optimal Strategies in Iterated Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma
For my final project in *MATH 4630: Nonlinear Optimization*, I wrote a [program](https://github.com/devinjbarkey/devinjbarkey.github.io/tree/main/MATH%204630%20Project) which created a so-called genetic algorithm to attempt to identify optimal strategies for the iterated prisoner's dilemma game.

## Building an Education-only Model to Predict 2020 Presidential Results
For my part of a group final project for *PSCI 2300: Introduction to Data Science for Politics*, I built a linear model to predict the 2020 presidential election in five swing states using only education data.
